General requirements:

Minimum requirements in your C++ implementation: 
Use 2 or more data files as the input to your project.  (By the way, all the above datasets contain 2 or more data files.)
Design and implement at least two algorithms that are not sorting or searching.   
Declare and implement at least two classes (Note: These are user-defined data types and need to be meaningful.)     
Your C++ project will use separate program files.
